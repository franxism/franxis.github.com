
MAME GP32 1.1 Código Fuente (08/06/2005)
----------------------------------------

http://www.talfi.net/gp32_franxis/

Entorno de desarrollo: DevKitARM r11 + GPSDK

Esta adaptación esta basada en MAME 0.34.

Antes de compilar es necesario comentar los #defines siguientes del fichero
gpdef.h del directorio "include" del GPSDK: byte,word,dword. No hay ningún
problema en ello ya que estas definiciones no son usadas en todo el GPSDK.

Gracias y un saludo.
